# Project Tasks
- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Write initial README content
- [ ] Machine Learning Algo solution should automatically identify and quantify data drift between a provided training dataset and a test dataset. It must be capable of analyzing a wide range of features, applying appropriate statistical and distance-based metrics to detect various types of drift, and highlighting features that exhibit significant changes.
- [ ] UI. For every identified drift, your system should include an intuitive interface that produces clear, insightful visualizations to help users understand the extent, direction, and nature of the shift.
- [ ] Design and implement automated mitigation techniques that adaptively handle the detected drifts during model training. These strategies should aim to preserve or enhance model performance under shifting data distributions.

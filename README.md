# Project Tasks
- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Write initial README content
- [ ] Machine Learning Algo solution should automatically identify and quantify data drift between a provided training dataset and a test dataset. It must be capable of analyzing a wide range of features, applying appropriate statistical and distance-based metrics to detect various types of drift, and highlighting features that exhibit significant changes.
- [ ] UI. For every identified drift, your system should include an intuitive interface that produces clear, insightful visualizations to help users understand the extent, direction, and nature of the shift.
- [ ] Design and implement automated mitigation techniques that adaptively handle the detected drifts during model training. These strategies should aim to preserve or enhance model performance under shifting data distributions. 

# Deliverables
Data drift detection framework that can:
Automatically identify feature types and apply the most appropriate statistical metrics to detect drift.
Adapt to new datasets with varying feature sets and data structures.
Generate intuitive visualizations that clearly illustrate the extent, nature, and potential impact of data drift for end users.

Documentation and presentation on the developed AI solution, including:
List of frameworks, and development tools used
Overview of the end-to-end solution workflow, including data drift detection and mitigation steps
Explanation and architecture of models used in the final solution
Detailed final model performance with relevant metrics
Justification for chosen approaches and comparison to other possible solutions
Limitations or known weaknesses of the solution
Frontend tool or dashboard (optional but recommended) to demonstrate data drift detection and correction in action

Public GitHub repository link with:
